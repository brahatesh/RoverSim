# RoverSim
Open Projects 2021

## Abstract

The project aims to introduce the Path-Planning phase to a wireless rover to make it capable to navigate autonomously in an environment with the help of path planning algorithms (Dijkstra and SLAM) parsed by a python script. It aims to reach the destination through the shortest path and shortest time. This was done using ROS navigation stack by performing a simulation of a rover model in Gazebo environment, by running ROS (Melodic Morenia) in Ubuntu 18.04. The robot used in this project is Turtlebot 3.

## Motivation

Watching a robot move on its own without any human input is always fascinating. So, our team of 5 freshers decided to take on the challenge to learn how a robot maps the environment, find its position in the map of the environment and move from one position to another on its own.
The future will be fully automated with the help of robots and for that automated navigation will be extremely important. So making a small robot move automatically is the first step.
